# ES6 & TypeScript Showcase

Mastering destructuring, spread, and more with TypeScript.

## Mini-Demos
- In `/mini-demos/`.
- Examples: Object destructuring for pet stats.

## Creative Project
- **Pixel Pet Manager**: Manage virtual pets with TS and ES6 features.
- See `/pixel-pets-manager/`.

## How to Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` (Formats & builds TS)
3. Open `pixel-pets-manager/index.html`.

## What I Learned
- Destructuring makes access to code cleaner and less repetitive 
- Spread/rest operators are some cool ways to handle (object/array) data
